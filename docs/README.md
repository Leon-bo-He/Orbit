> Content ops for creators managing multiple content verticals across any platform.

Orbit handles everything *around* creation — capturing ideas before they slip away, planning content with structured briefs, tracking each piece through its full production lifecycle, coordinating multi-platform publishing, and recording performance metrics. It doesn't replace your creative tools; it connects them.

**Built for:** any creator juggling multiple content areas — comedy shorts, lifestyle posts, long-form tech writing — and publishing across any combination of platforms: Douyin, YouTube, Instagram, X, Xiaohongshu, WeChat, TikTok, or a custom channel of your own. One place to stay on top of it all without letting anything fall through the cracks.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Idea capture** | Zero-friction capture from anywhere. Ideas land in a global pool — no forced categorization required. Promote to a content item when ready. |
| **Workspaces** | Each account or vertical gets its own isolated workspace with independent board, calendar, and analytics. |
| **Content Kanban** | Full lifecycle tracking: Planned → Creating → Ready → Published → Reviewed. Drag-and-drop between stages. |
| **Content Brief** | Structured creative planning — audience profile, goals & KPIs, hook analysis, title candidates, outline, and reference links. |
| **Scheduling Calendar** | Month / week / list views. Schedule by dragging. Color-coded by workspace. |
| **Publication Management** | One content item → independent per-platform records (copy, hashtags, cover, settings). Manual-assist publishing with push reminders. |
| **Analytics** | Manual metric entry with auto-calculated engagement rate. Per-workspace trends and per-post breakdowns. |
| **Multilingual** | zh-CN · zh-TW · en-US · ja-JP · ko-KR. Browser auto-detect with manual override. Locale-aware formatting throughout. |
| **PWA + Offline** | Installable from the browser. Offline idea capture and board access. Background Sync flushes queued writes on reconnect. |
| **Data portability** | Full JSON export of all workspaces, content, publications, metrics, and ideas. Import back from any export file. |
| **Custom platforms** | Define custom publishing platforms beyond the built-in list. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+
- Docker + Docker Compose

### Quick start

```bash
# Start Postgres + Redis
docker compose up -d

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run database migrations
pnpm migrate

# Start API (port 3000) and web app (port 5173) together
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and register an account.

### Demo account

To explore the app with pre-populated data, seed the demo account:

```bash
pnpm seed:demo
```

Then log in with:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `demo@orbit.app` |
| Password | `demo1234` |

The demo account includes 3 workspaces (Comedy, Lifestyle, Tech Insights), 26 content items across all Kanban stages, content briefs, 12 publications, and 8 weeks of metric data so every dashboard and chart renders with real content.

Run `pnpm seed:demo --force` to wipe and re-seed from scratch.

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The defaults work out of the box for local development. OAuth credentials are optional — leave them blank to use email/password auth only.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing tokens (min 32 chars in production) |
| `WECHAT_APP_ID` / `WECHAT_APP_SECRET` | WeChat OAuth (optional) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth (optional) |
